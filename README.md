## Text Simplification

The main goal of this project is to create a tool of text simplification, notably for people suffering of comprehension issue (such as aphasics) in english. It corresponds to change the form of several types of sentences (passive voice for exemple) to be understood easier.

### project.py
This file contain all the simplification modules for the the project. In order to use this file a python 3.6 environment is needed. The file tok.pkl is also needed it contain the tokenizer use for the lexical simplification.
The file main.py allow you to run project.py via our interface: use the command line:   python main.py


**Here you will find different folders with their content:**


### Article

The set of articles used in research for text simplification in each domains we study:
*Neurolinguistics* - *Syntactic simplification* - *Cognitive Science* - *Semantic Simplification*

### Presentation

The slides of the weekly presentations that contain our progression on the project (updated every session)

### Report

The elements of the final report in process (pdf, annexes) but also the schedule of the steps to build the project

### Results 

The code and the results of the tests obtained (will come soon as the coding part will start)

For the passive to active conversion , we use the code done by https://github.com/DanManN/pass2act , we made some modifications in order to improve the results. For this part of the code we need to use 3.6 version of python
